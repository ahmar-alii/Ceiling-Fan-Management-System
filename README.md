# Ceiling-Fan-Management-System
The Ceiling Fan Management System is a full-stack CRUD app using React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. It allows users to add, update, delete, and view fan details, including brand, model, size, waterproof status, price, and warranty. The backend handles API requests, while the React frontend displays fan data in a table with edit and delete options.
